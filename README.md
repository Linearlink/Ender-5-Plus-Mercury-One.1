## **In the unlikely event that anyone but my eyes are to gaze upon this repo...**

My config is a bit of a bloated mess, but a well functioning one nonetheless. 

Ender 5 Plus Mercury One.1 conversion (partial, 8mm bed but stock mount, no Hydra), 
Printer is running an Octopus pro F429 with TMC 2209's, EBB36 Canboard (over the RJ11, no additional CAN board),
Custom rear facing hotend cable arm (why is the default one so long and far to the right, crap for CAN cable IMO),
Sherpa Mini, 
Phaetus Rapido (PT1000),
Klicky Probe (Trihorn Mount),
Custom nozzle brush,
Preciseprinterparts 8mm bed,
and many other non essential gizmos and doodads
